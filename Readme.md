# Neural Network Design: Deep Learning

![](FrontCoverSmall.jpg)

This site is under development. It contains the textbook **Neural Network Design: Deep Learning** and related material. When completed, there will be a folder for every chapter of the book. Each folder will have a Docs subfolder contain PDF files of the chapter and associated slides. For chapters covering code, there will be a Code subfolder containing a Jupyter Notebook of the chapter, as well as Jupyter Notebook labs.

## Python Demos
There are interactive Python demonstrations that are integrated into most chapters of the book, in order to illustrate important concepts. These can be installed using pip. See the associated [website](https://pypi.org/project/nndesigndemos/).

## First Volume
This book is a second volume in the Neural Network Design series. Information on the first book is contained [here](https://hagan.okstate.edu/nnd.html).
